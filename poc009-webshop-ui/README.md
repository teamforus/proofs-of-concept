# poc012-webshop-ui
### v0.1

## Asignee: [jamalv](https://github.com/jamalv)

## Background / Context
**Goal:** To create a concept for a webshop that allows for sponsorship of goods and services.

## Method
The designs will go trough phases, each with their own focus. 

1. Technical: The first focus of the UI POCs is to align the engineering efforts. Based on the designs we can make a prototype combining the technical POCs with the user interface POCs. 

2. User experience: When we made a technical prototype we will start focussing on improving the user experience.

## Result
The resulting webshop provides three main groups of functionality:

### Request
Just like in a regular webshop, the user first looks up the product/service they would like to order. They are then presented with the option to pay for the product. They are also presented with the option to gather more validations. These validations enable them to unlock sponsored funds. After payment they will recieve a voucher that can be loaded into the app. When presenting this voucher to a provider, they can recieve the product/service, and the provider is paid.

### Provide
The provider picks or creates the product or service that they would like to offer. They then set the sales price. The provider also has the option to donate their product by setting criteria that the requester has to meet. By using the app, the provider can scan the voucher codes, enabling to recieve the funds.

### Sponsor  
The sponsor first picks a product or service. They can then add money to the fund, set an upper limit for each requester to recieve and set the criteria they have to meet to recieve the funding.

## Recommendation
To keep the scope limited and focus on the technical aspects. We will learn a lot from interacting with the first prototypes and will make changes. Spending time on design and more advanced features in this stage would be inneficient.
